title: "Development of predictive QSAR models on the phosphopeptide binding affinity against 14-3-3 isoforms"
summary: "14-3-3s present in a multiple-isoforms fashion in mammalian cells and are involved in mediating manysignal transduction activities by binding to the phosphorylated ligands. It is also demonstrated that14-3-3s act as a key factor in inducing chemoresistance of tumorigenesis from the current findings.Thus, 14-3-3s are regarded as a novel candidate for biomarker development and cancer therapy. Inthis work, we developed the predictive models that can determine the binding affinity of the phos-phopeptide fragments against 14-3-3s by the computational methods."
