I am a Postdoctor of system biology at the Teaching and Research Division of School of Chinese Medicine, Hong Kong Baptist University and at the HKBU Shenzhen Institute of Research and Continuing Education. I earned my PhD in Fermentation Engineering from South China University of Technology, China and my BSc of Biotechnology from Henan Agricultural University, China. 

My research intersts include system biology, gene transcription network, microbiology genomics. I work in a research team that focus on network pharmacology in traditional chinese medicine and led by Professor Aiping Lyu.
