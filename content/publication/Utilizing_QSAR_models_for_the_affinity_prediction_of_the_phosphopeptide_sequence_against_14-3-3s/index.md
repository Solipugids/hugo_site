abstract : "Human 14-3-3s protein family presents in multiple isoforms in living cells and mediate signal transduction by binding to the ligands with phosphorylated residues. Despite different isoforms in the 14-3-3s family present high structural similarities, the variances exist in the preference of the dimerization and ligand binding specificity for each isoform. These interactions are critical for the activation of signal transduction processes and the details are not fully understood still. The purpose of this study is to develop the predictive QSAR models that can determine the binding affinity of phosphopeptide fragments against 14-3-3s."
